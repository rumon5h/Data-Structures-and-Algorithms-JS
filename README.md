### What is an algorithms?

* Ans:- An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to particular problem.
* Ans:- An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem.

### Characteristics

* Well defined inputs and outputs
* Each step should be clear and unambiguous
* Language independent

### Why algorithms?

* As a developer, you're going to come across problems that you nee to solve.
* Learning algorithms translates to learning different techniques to efficiently solve those problems.
* One problem can be solved in many ways using different algorithms.
* Every algorithm comes with its own tradeoffs when it comes to performance.
